###### There are some books that I can enjoy with a smile on my face, put them in a bag to take to the twice-loved bookstore or store in the archives of my ebook library, walk away, and forget I ever read them.  Other books stick around a while.  Maybe I remember a few details that spoke to me.  Maybe I will fall in love with the characters.  These books I might even reread and enjoy them all the more the second time around.&#xA;&#xA;Then there are the books that rip my heart out and threaten my very existence.  Those books are never to be read again, even as the details refuse to be forgotten.  They wallow on my bookshelf, waiting for the day when I can handle picking them up again, because I also can’t let them go.  

###### When I first started reading \*Between Sisters \*(2003) by Kristin Hannah, I thought maybe the book would be in the second group, the first group being reserved for dime store romances (I like them for quick reads, but they’re not going to give Jane Austen a run for her money).  The theme was one I’d read before.  Two sisters on the outs, a man down on his luck… The question wasn’t if they would resolve their problems, but how.

###### Meghann Dontess is the kind of person I love to hate… at first.  From the first scene, she comes across as the epitome of the cynical divorce lawyer, herself divorced, with the legacy of a mother who never learned to settle down.  Her only friends are her therapist, a college buddy who lives across the country, and her partner at the Seattle law firm where she works.  Meghann doesn’t believe in love and nothing will change her mind, until a stray bullet forces her to take stock of her life.

###### Her sister, Claire Cavenaugh, is more down-to-earth.  Single mother to a precocious daughter and caretaker for her father’s rental cabins in a small town two hours from Seattle, she has learned that love is fleeting, but that doesn’t stop her from grabbing hold of it with both hands when she has the chance.  She is surrounded by her friends, the Bluesers, and is finally in love with the man of her dreams.

###### I wish I could say that their story is one of only fun and laughter, that I rolled on the floor with tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.  If that were the case, this review might have a different opening.  From the onset, Meghann’s love for Claire, the guilt she felt over years of neglect and self-loathing, and the way she tries to protect her sister from further harm, was a reminder that sisterhood doesn’t mean that you always get along, but that you will always be there when it counts.

###### Add to the mix, Joe Wyatt, a man who is haunted by the death of his wife and believes that he never deserves to have a second chance at love or life.  It’s hard to talk about Joe without giving away spoilers, but I feel as if he deserves to be mentioned, because let’s face it, he is the hero of the story.  Joe is the character that, despite his reluctant involvement,  had me chanting “please, please, please” in hopes that he would step up to the plate.  Without him, I would have thrown this book in the fire and watched it burn.  No offense to Kristin Hannah; actually, if I had done that, she could see that as a compliment.  It meant that she did her job well, even if the ending was shot all to pieces.  

###### Joe is the type of character that I love to read.  Grief-stricken, stuck in a hell of his own making, he is hiding from the truth of his past by working as a transient laborer.  When he first walks onto the page, nobody would recognize the man he used to be.  Even as I read about his journey homeward, I wondered how he would be able to teach Meghann how to love again, because that was where my romance-soaked imagination was taking me.  So, when they met for the first time, I wasn’t surprised by their level of attraction.  I was anticipating it.  More to the point, I wondered how Meghann would be able to rip him away from his six-foot deep well of grief.  How do two people who hate themselves learn to trust in themselves and love again?  

###### Now, I know this is not a dime store romance.  I know that Kristin Hannah is better than that, having loved her books for years.  I know when I pick up one of her books, I’m in for the ride of my life.  However, I was not prepared for the loops and turns of the roller coaster in which she strapped me down.  What I believed would be a leisurely scenic drive suddenly dipped into a rapidly descending canyon where there were nothing but bumpy roads and cave-ins.  Once I reached the second half of the book, I found myself both unable to put the book down and unable to read any further.  As a result, I would say to any fellow readers, read this book with a box of tissues and your favorite happy playlist on standby.  You are going to need it.

###### As for which group on my bookshelf *Between Sisters* belongs to, of course it’s the third.  I don’t know if the day will come when I can enjoy the story of Meghann, Claire, and Joe for a second time, but it will always have a place on my bookshelf and in my heart.

##### **5 out of 5 stars**
