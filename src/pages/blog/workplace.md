I’ve been reading a lot of historical romances lately (going back to my roots) and I found one series of books that I would set apart from the usual round of parties, dresses, and trips to Bath that one finds in a Regency England romance.  Christi Caldwell’s *Lost Lords of London* series (which came out last year) are well worth a read.  This is the first time I have read any of Caldwell’s books, but I am looking forward to reading more from her in the future.  On a rating scale, I would give Christi Caldwell’s *The* *Lost Lords of London* four out of five stars.  They were written well, with few noticeable grammatical mistakes.  *Undressed with the Marquess* does have an author’s note warning the reader about scenes of violence and abuse.  I will admit, those scenes, while brief, are hard to take in.  Otherwise, take a lazy evening or two with a cup of coffee, kick up your feet and enjoy.  

Made up of three novels,the *Lost Lords of London* take the reader on a tour of East London where the poorest of the poor eke out an existence of scrounging, fighting, and stealing for their next meal.  Amidst their numbers, three men who should have lived in luxury have made names for themselves by sweat and blood.

*In Bed with the Earl* introduces us to Malcolm North, the Earl of Maxwell, who was kidnapped after his parents were killed and grew up as a tosher, picking up bits of jewelry and other valuables that found their way to the sewers of St. Giles, until he was the most ruthless and most powerful of men in the underground world.  Verity Lovelace, a down-on-her-luck reporter, picks up the story of a lord lost to greed and attempts to figure out the man behind the urban legend.  The illegitimate daughter to an earl, Verity finds herself thrust into society at Malcolm’s side, and together they find a life of love and forgiveness.

*In the Dark with the Duke* - the second book in the series - sees Hugh Savage, the Duke of Wingate, brawling for his life after being sold to a fight society as a child.  By the time Lady Lila March gets up the courage to approach him for self-defense lessons, he has cycled from one type of battle to another before ending up back where he started - a man just trying to survive.  With Lila at his side, he is finally able to come to grips with his past and find a life of peace and love.

Finally, in *Undressed with the Marquess, *Darius Greyson, the Marquess of Milford, finds himself saved from the hangman’s noose when his grandparents and sister insist he give up a life of playing Robin Hood and come home to save the family estate from destitution.  When offered money to either marry off his sister or produce an heir, “Dare” - as he prefers to call himself - goes to the one person in his life who he trusts to help him: his wife, Temperance.  Temperance, born to a violent man from the Rookeries, is the last person his grandparents were expecting Dare to bring home.  With a life full of nothing but heartbreak, Temperance has managed to keep her head held high and her sense of morality intact.  Now, with her devil-may-care husband asking her to back him in his latest venture, she has the difficult task of teaching him what it means to lay down a life of crime and be a true lord of the realm.  

While the thrill of Regency romance novels lies in the privileged lives of aristocratic society in and around Mayfair or Grosvenor Square, it is always refreshing to find an author willing to show the other side of life in East London - where survival often meant giving in to violence and crime.  Our heroes in these tales have a unique twist in having lived both privileged lives and ones of desperation; and it is the women they love that teach them how to reconcile the choices they made to survive, as well as learning how to survive in a world they believed to be lost to them.

I would say I was impressed, not only with the way that Caldwell portrayed the world of East London, but also with the women she wrote.  Verity Lovelace had the weight of raising her sister and keeping a roof over both of their heads as she fought to make it in a male dominated profession.  Lila March overcame her demons while simultaneously falling in love with a man with deeper psychological trauma.  However, it was Temperance Swift who really stood out to me.  She was the only one who was truly from East London, Verity and Lila having been born from aristocratic families or bloodlines.  Out of all three women, Temperance had the strongest belief in her self-worth and it was this strength that allowed her to sway the hearts of not only her husband but his sister and the people under their care, even while she trudged through learning the steps of aristocratic life.

**4 out 5 Stars**
